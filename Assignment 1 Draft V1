1.   Group Members
1.           [Viet Richard Tran] [s3707735]
[Background and Passion in IT]

I have been nominated as team leader 

2.           [Kelvin Truong] [s3717846]
[Half Chinese/half Vietnamese, speaks Cantonese to family members.
Passion in IT stemmed from my interest and love in gaming, branched out to becoming interested in PCs and hence, IT.]
[Interested in gaming and music. Quite good in time-management if I say so myself. Not particularly bad at anything.]
[Not very knowledgeable in IT; very little programming skills. My volume isn’t very quite loud either, so it might be a problem for my group members.]
[Was the ‘leader’ during my group projects in the previous semester, so I’d be able to lend a hand taking initiatives. Would also help giving or extending our ideas.]

2.   Project Description
[ Describe the IT system you intend to build and include details of the functionality it will provide. Pitch your description so that someone with moderate technical knowledge will understand the project outcomes without ambiguity. Categorise your project. This section should also identify the type of project this is; a mobile app, web app, a game or something else. It should also contain description of the functionality of the product.]

This type of project is a mobile app 
The IT system Mysterious Frogs intends to build is a mobile app that can generate recipes by scanning in the ingredients of any kind that the consumer has readily available in their pantry and fridge. Once the items have been scanned in, a number of recipes will be generated by the mobile app allowing the consumer to choose what recipe they would like to cook. The recipes are easy to understand and is intended for beginners or novices to cooking. This mobile app would be categorised as a life skill app. 

3. Motivation
None of us here in the group cooks for ourselves, nor do we know how to. So an app such as this would be helpful towards students such as ourselves, whether it be now or in the future, where we are sure there are plenty of out there.
This app will teach people (e.g., adult children who have moved out) with limited cooking abilities to cook
Allows time poor parents and full-time workers to cook a meal with the ingredients they have readily at home 
People on a budget or low socioeconomic backgrounds should be able to cook a nutritious and healthy meal

2.   [Description of validation test ]

5.   Justification
a)   Workload
[ Justify your expected and actual workloads ]

b)  Beyond Current Capabilities
[ Rationalise and contrast the expected versus beyond expected capabilities]
6.   Risks
Risk [Not knowing how to ‘do something’ and not getting any help online.]
Example: [If we were to create this app on the basis of taking pictures of ingredients, whether it be the ingredients themselves or its barcode, we would need the app to do so, but since all of us are 1st years, we would not be able to know how to ‘execute’ such a task, and so we resort to searching on Google for tutorials and such. However, Google isn’t returning any useful results and so, we are left still not knowing how to, and hence, unable to complete our app.]
Mitigation: [We could either think of alternatives such as the user manually entering in the ingredients they have themselves or asking someone who is knowledgeable in IT in person for help.]
 
Risk [ Description of risk goes here. ]
Example: [Certain tools we are depending on to build our XYZ are no longer available ]
Mitigation: [ Description of mitigation efforts goes here. Example: Identify alternative tools to ensure that our work is done using an open standard]
