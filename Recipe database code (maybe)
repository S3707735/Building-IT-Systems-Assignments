I was working on my own MVF (3) and only realized halfway through that I was thinking of MVF 5 (Manual search recipes) instead of 3 (Manual 
input of ingredients). So I'm gunna post what I have for now and get everyone's opinion on whether we should use this 'database' (array) as
a basis for everyone's code (for consistency).

--------- Code starts here ----------
import java.util.HashMap;

public class MVF3 {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// Since we aren't importing in an entire list of recipe, and instead just 50 recipes, manual searching
		// would be too difficult unless the user knows exactly what all 50 recipes are name-by-name, in most,
		// if not all cases, they would not (us included). So we would now make it so the user searches for the 
		// number assigned to each recipe instead for an easier and more consistent (working) function.
		HashMap<Integer, String> recipes = new HashMap<Integer, String>();
		
		// Creating list of recipes
		// Source: https://www.thedailymeal.com/best-recipes/50-most-popular-recipes-2017
