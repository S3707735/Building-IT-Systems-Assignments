I was working on my own MVF (3) and only realized halfway through that I was thinking of MVF 5 (Manual search recipes) instead of 3 (Manual 
input of ingredients). So I'm gunna post what I have for now and get everyone's approval for the recipe 'database' (array) that we'll be 
using for our own codes.
