Features still missing: 
- After ingredient list has been submitted, the system should return recipes with matching ingredients.
- The ability to remove an ingredient from the ingredients list.
- Maybe better visuals/interface.

----------------------------- Code done so far --------------------------------
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class MVF3 {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// Creating array of ingredients inputed
		ArrayList<String> ingredientsList = new ArrayList<String>();
				
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		// User enters in ingredient
		System.out.println("(Type in 'Generate' when list is completed)");
		boolean generate = false;
		
		while (generate == false) {
			System.out.println("Enter ingredient to input into your ingredients list: ");
			String ingredient = sc.nextLine();
			// When user is completed with their list, exit out of the loop
			if (ingredient.contains("Generate")) {
				generate = true;
			}
			// If not, user continues to add in ingredients into the list until stated otherwise
			else {
				ingredientsList.add(ingredient);
			}
			System.out.println("Ingredients list: " + ingredientsList);
		}
		
		System.out.println("Ingredients list has been submitted into the system. Now generating recipes...");

	}

}

----------------------------- End of code. Below is a demo of what the code does (so far) --------------------------------
(Type in 'Generate' when list is completed)
Enter ingredient to input into your ingredients list: 
Eggs
Ingredients list: [Eggs]
Enter ingredient to input into your ingredients list: 
Bacon
Ingredients list: [Eggs, Bacon]
Enter ingredient to input into your ingredients list: 
Generate
Ingredients list: [Eggs, Bacon]
Ingredients list has been submitted into the system. Now generating recipes...
